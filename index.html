                Weddings can be long events. I want to make sure you look amazing from the moment you show up to the moment you leave. I stay onsite for the ceremony, the photos, and even the party to do touch ups as you need them.

                There are no redos when it comes to your wedding. I offer a 100% money-back guarantee because there is nothing more important to me than you feeling and looking your best on your big day.
